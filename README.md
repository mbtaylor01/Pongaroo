# 🏓 Pongaroo 🏓

I made this game a few years ago when I was learning Python and still enjoy it!  

It's my version of 1-player Pong created with Turtle graphics.  

Every bounce angle is accurately calculated and the ball gets faster with every point.

The multiprocessing library is used for sound effects so they don't interrupt the game loop.
